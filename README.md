Experimentation with webpack, react, backbone and asynchronous loading of routes<br/><br/>

Playing aroung with require.ensure feature of webpack to load each route asynchronously,<br/>
plus server side rendering of react components.<br/><br/>

More experimentations todo:<br/>
1. Load react data asynchronously on server side and pass them onto client to initialise the same react components.<br/>
2. Package child components styles to be loaded asynchornously as well.<br/>
